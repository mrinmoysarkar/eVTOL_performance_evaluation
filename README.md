The code is developed based on the following project:
https://github.com/colineRamee/UAM_simulator_scitech2021
and highly dependent on the following project https://github.com/suavecode/SUAVE.
A version of the SUAVE(2.4) is included in this project. So no installation is required for the SUAVE libraries.

Please cite the following papers if you are using this code:
