def vsp_read(tag, units_type='SI'): 	
	"""This reads an OpenVSP vehicle geometry and writes it into a SUAVE vehicle format.
	Includes wings, fuselages, and propellers.

	Assumptions:
	1. OpenVSP vehicle is composed of conventionally shaped fuselages, wings, and propellers. 
	1a. OpenVSP fuselage: generally narrow at nose and tail, wider in center). 
	1b. Fuselage is designed in VSP as it appears in real life. That is, the VSP model does not rely on
	   superficial elements such as canopies, stacks, or additional fuselages to cover up internal lofting oddities.
	1c. This program will NOT account for multiple geometries comprising the fuselage. For example: a wingbox mounted beneath
	   is a separate geometry and will NOT be processed.
	2. Fuselage origin is located at nose. VSP file origin can be located anywhere, preferably at the forward tip
	   of the vehicle or in front (to make all X-coordinates of vehicle positive).
	3. Written for OpenVSP 3.21.1
	
	Source:
	N/A

	Inputs:
	1. A tag for an XML file in format .vsp3.
	2. Units_type set to 'SI' (default) or 'Imperial'

	Outputs:
	Writes SUAVE vehicle with these geometries from VSP:    (All values default to SI. Any other 2nd argument outputs Imperial.)
