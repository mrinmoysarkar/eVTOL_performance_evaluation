Git Branching Basics

1. Create branch on github
    a. find the dropdown menu for branches, right above the box listing the files in the repo.
    b. type in the name of your new branch.  
    
    # Naming
    the name of your branch should reflect the feature you're working on. do not name it after yourself.
    
    # IMPORTANT!
    the convention we'll use is "feature-*".  some examples are --
    feature-turbofan
    feature-new_mission
    
2. pull the changes locally
> git pull

3. list all the branches
> git branch -a

4. create a local branch
> git checkout -b branch_name remotes/origin/branch_name

the branch you created on github is a "remote" branch, since it lives on the github site and your local copy tracks it.  this command creates a local copy of that remote branch, and any changes you push here will show up on github

at this point you've checked out your new branch and can add/commit/push/pull changes like normal.

5. list your local branches
> git branch

6. to switch between branches
> git checkout master
> git checkout branch_name
